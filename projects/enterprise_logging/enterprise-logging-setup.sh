oc new-project logging

oc create -f \

### Make sure to delete any old secret, and use a new empty secret.  
### This secret will be used by kibana to talk to ES servers, and scrape the logs.  very important that its in sync.
sudo oc delete secret logging-deployer || echo "couldn't delete secret!!!!!!" ; sleep 5
sudo oc secrets new logging-deployer nothing=/dev/null
 
## Now create svc/roles

oc create -f - <<API

kind: ServiceAccount

  name: logging-deployer
secrets:

API

oc policy add-role-to-user edit --serviceaccount logging-deployer

oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:logging:aggregated-logging-fluentd

oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:logging:aggregated-logging-fluentd

### Finally start deploying the logging components.

oc process logging-deployer-template -v KIBANA_HOSTNAME=kibana.example.com,ES_CLUSTER_SIZE=1,PUBLIC_MASTER_URL=https://localhost:8443,IMAGE_VERSION=3.1.0,IMAGE_PREFIX=registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ | oc create -f -

echo "now, edit the port for spreading, containerPort: 9200 , hostPort: 1234"
sleep 2
oc edit template logging-es-template 

until oc get pods | grep -q Completed
do
	oc get pods
	echo "waiting for completion..."
	sleep 1
done

oc process logging-support-template | oc create -f -

### You should see some ELK pods by now 

oc get pods --all-namespaces

echo "Not gauranteed that everything will pass w/ exit code 0 below, so unsetting -e"
echo "For example: Some creates may fail but probably its nothing to worry about (yet) :)"
unset -e
 
### Now deploy the rest of the infra

oc process logging-support-template | oc create -f -

oc get dc --selector logging-infra=elasticsearch

# Now scale up the ES instances...
oc process logging-es-template | oc create -f -

oc get pods --all-namespaces

### Finally, create FluentD replicas...

oc scale dc/logging-fluentd --replicas=10

### You should see something like this...
